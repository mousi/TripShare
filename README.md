# TripShare
TripShare is a team project for ITECH 2015.

Clone the application to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/mousi/TripShareProject.git
```

To install it to your machine, first create a virtual environment <name>. 
```
mkvirtualenv <name>
```

When the environment is created, go to the application's folder in your machine and enter:
```
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
It will install all the necessary packages in order to use this application.

Now, you need to setup the database for the application. 
<ol>
<li>If you work on Windows, you need to enter the following:</li>
  <ol>
    <li><i>python manage.py makemigrations TripShare</i></li>
    <li><i>python manage.py migrate</i></li>
    <li><i>python populate_trip.py</i></li>
  </ol>
  
  <li>If you work in a UNIX based machine, there is a script ready to create the database and populate it.
In your terminal, enter: <i>./update_db.sh </i></li>
</ol>

If you want to create an admin enter the following:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
and follow the instructions. There is a super user in the live demo with credentials: <b>username:</b> root, <b>password:</b> tripshare .

Finally, enter the following to your terminal:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
There are some premade accounts created for you:
<table>
<tr><th>Username</th><th>Password</th></tr>
<tr><td>mousi</td><td>tripshare</td></tr>
<tr><td>geo</td><td>tripshare</td></tr>
<tr><td>jenny</td><td>tripshare</td></tr>
<tr><td>liverpoolaras</td><td>tripshare</td></tr>
<tr><td>thanos</td><td>tripshare</td></tr>
